[@legacymtgsalvationuser69544](https://github.com/legacymtgsalvationuser69544/Edges-Tileset) for building the edges in the first place making Unciv so much more graphically awesome.
Myself, I remixed the existing edge base, and added/changed coloring for certain tiles for better blending.
@yairm210 for [coding the edges](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/commit/a91d32874b24de011935bfb0d3ae30d9a2927c8f) and so much more.
